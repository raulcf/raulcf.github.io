I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at The
University of Chicago, where I am also on the Committee on Data Science. I am
interested in all things data. My research agenda, data ecology, explores how
data affects our technological, economic, social, and cultural ecosystems. We
study ecosystems via dataflows and propose interventions--- primarily technical,
but also economic, social, and others---to control dataflows so we extract the
value of data while avoiding its potential harm. In addition, I am interested in
designing and implementing systems for data discovery and processing. I received
a SIGMOD'23 Test-of-Time Award, an NSF CAREER in 2024, and I was named a Sloan
Research Fellow in 2025. After doing my PhD at
Imperial College London (in distributed data processing) I did a postdoc at MIT
(in data discovery).  I thank everyone who makes our research possible,
including DSI@UChicago, the Department of Economics at UChicago, NSF, and
industrial gifts.
