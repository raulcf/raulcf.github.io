<!--			The data revolution is here. For this revolution to be
beneficial for our society our capacity to explore and understand data must

Today we generate more data than we know how to comprehend. To benefit from the
value hidden in data, our capacity to explore and understand it must match our
capacity to generate it. In my research I work on problems geared towards
bridging the gap. I like designing and building systems to solve practical
problems; my research interests lie at the intersection of databases, systems
and distributed systems.

a data discovery problem when their analysts spend more time looking for
relevant data than analyzing it. This problem has become commonplace in modern
organizations as: i) data is stored across multiple storage systems, from
databases to data lakes; ii) data scientists do not operate within the limits of
well-defined schemas or a small number of data sources – instead, to answer
complex questions they must access data spread across thousands of data sources.
To address this problem we propose to capture relationships between datasets in
an enterprise knowledge graph (EKG), which helps users to navigate among the
disparate sources. In this paper, we present AURUM, a system to build, maintain
and query the EKG. Building is challenging due to the quadratic complexity of
computing all the relationships between datasets. We introduce a 2-step process
to build the EKG in an approximate and scalable manner. Maintaining the EKG is
challenging if we want to avoid recomputing it from scratch. We introduce RESS,
a resource-efficient sampling signature method that helps to keep the EKG
up-to-date. Last, because discovery needs are varied, we cannot specify a closed
set of applications on top of the EKG, because that would not satisfy most
users. Instead, we introduce a source retrieval query language (SRQL) which
consists of a set of primitives that are arbitrarily composable and an execution
engine that allows users to express different discovery queries and execute them
efficiently. We evaluate the scalability of our 2-step process to build the EKG,
as well as the efficiency of RESS to maintain it, and the performance of SRQL
execution engine to query the EKG. Last, we put everything together and report
our experience after real deployments of AURUM across several companies." class="tooltip">Abstract

spend more time finding relevant data than analyzing it suffer a data discovery
problem. The large volume of data in enterprises, and sometimes the lack of
knowledge of the schemas aggravates this problem. Similar to how we navigate the
Web today, we propose to identify semantic links that assist analysts in their
discovery tasks. These links relate tables to each other, to facilitate
navigating the schemas. They also relate data to external data sources such as
ontologies and dictionaries, to help explain the schema meaning. We materialize
the links in an enterprise knowledge graph, where they become available to
analysts. The main challenge is how to find pairs of objects that are
semantically related. We propose SEMPROP, a DAG of different components that
find links based on syntactic and semantic similarities. SEMPROP is commanded by
a semantic matcher which leverages word embeddings to find objects that are
semantically related. To leverage word embeddings, we introduce coherent groups,
a novel technique to combine them which works better than other state of the art
alternatives for this problem. We implement SEMPROP as part of a discovery
system we are building and conduct user studies, real deployments and a
quantitative evaluation to understand the benefits of links for data discovery
tasks, as well as the benefits of SEMPROP and coherent groups to find those
links." class="tooltip">Abstract

systems such as Apache Spark and Flink are used to derive new insights from
large datasets. While they efficiently execute concrete workflows expressed as
dataflow graphs, they lack generic support for exploratory workflows: if a user
is uncertain about the correct data processing pipeline to employ, e.g. in terms
of data cleaning strategy or choice of model parameters, they must repeatedly
submit modified jobs to the system. Current systems therefore miss out on
optimisation opportunities for exploratory workflows, both in terms of efficient
cluster scheduling and memory allocation. We describe meta-dataflows (MDFs), a
new model that effectively expresses exploratory workflows and efficiently
executes them on compute clusters. With MDFs, users specify a family of dataflow
graphs using two new primitives: (a) an explore operator automatically explores
unbound options in a dataflow graph; and (b) a choose operator assesses the
result quality of explored dataflow branches, selecting a subset of results. We
propose techniques for a dataflow system to execute MDFs efficiently: it can (i)
avoid redundant computation when exploring options by reusing intermediate
results and terminating underperforming branches; and it can (ii) allocate
cluster memory for intermediate results more effectively by considering future
data access patterns in the MDF. Our experimental evaluation with data mining
and machine learning use cases shows that MDFs improve the runtime of
exploratory workflows by up to 90% compared to sequential job execution." class="tooltip">Abstract

columns contain string or numerical data that conforms to a pattern, such as
phone numbers, dates, addresses, product identifiers, and employee ids. These
patterns are useful in a number of data processing applications, including
understanding what a specific field represents when field names are ambiguous,
identifying outlier values, and finding similar fields across data sets.  One
way to express such patterns would be to learn regular expressions for each
field in the database. Unfortunately, existing techniques on regular expression
learning are slow, taking hundreds of seconds for columns of just a few thousand
values. In contrast, we develop XSYSTEM, an efficient method to learn patterns
over database columns in significantly less time.  We show that these patterns
can not only be built quickly, but are expressive enough to capture a number of
key applications, including detecting outliers, measuring column similarity, and
assigning semantic labels to columns (based on a library of regular
expressions). We evaluate these applications with datasets that range from
chemical databases (based on a collaboration with a pharmaceutical company), our
university data warehouse, and open data from MassData.gov." class="tooltip">Abstract

introduces Quill (stands for a quadrillion tuples per day), a library and
distributed platform for relational and temporal analytics over large datasets

computation, called ShardedStreamable. This abstraction provides the ability to
express efficient distributed physical query plans that are transferable, i.e.,
movable from offline to real-time and vice versa. ShardedStreamable decouples
incremental query logic specification, a small but rich set of data movement
operations, and keying; this allows Quill to express a broad space of plans with
complex querying functionality, while leveraging existing temporal libraries
such as Trill. Quill’s loosely-coupled layered architecture provides a careful
split of responsibilities with independently useful components, while
retaining high performance. We built Quill for the cloud, with a master-less
design where a language-integrated client library directly communicates and
coordinates with cloud workers using off-the-shelf distributed cloud components
such as queues. Experiments on up to 40 high-end cloud machines, on benchmark
and real datasets up to 1TB, find Quill to outperform SparkSQL by up to
orders-of-magnitude for temporal and 6× for relational queries, while supporting
a rich space of transferable, programmable, and expressive distributed physical

for training deep neural networks (DNNs) with large amounts of data have vastly
improved the accuracy of machine learning models for image and speech
recognition. DNN systems scale to large cluster deployments by having worker
nodes train many model replicas in parallel; to ensure model convergence,
parameter servers periodically synchronise the replicas. This raises the
challenge of how to split resources between workers and parameter servers so
that the cluster CPU and network resources are fully utilised without
introducing bottlenecks. In practice, this requires manual tuning for each model
configuration or hardware type.  We describe Ako, a decentralised dataflow-based
DNN system without parameter servers that is designed to saturate cluster
resources. All nodes execute workers that fully use the CPU resources to update
model replicas. To synchronise replicas as often as possible subject to the
available network bandwidth, workers exchange partitioned gradient updates
directly with each other. The number of partitions is chosen so that the used
network bandwidth remains constant, independently of cluster size. Since workers
eventually receive all gradient partitions after several rounds, convergence is
unaffected. For the ImageNet benchmark on a 64-node cluster, Ako does not
require any resource allocation decisions, yet converges faster than deployments
with parameter servers." class="tooltip">Abstract

played a critical role in ensuring data quality for enterprise applications.
Naturally, there has been extensive research in this area, and many data
cleaning algorithms have been translated into tools to detect and to possibly repair certain classes of errors such as outliers, duplicates, missing
values, and violations of integrity constraints. Since different types of errors
may coexist in the same data set, we often need to run more than one kind of
tool. In this paper, we investigate two pragmatic questions: (1) are these tools
robust enough to capture most errors in real-world data sets? and (2) what is
the best strategy to holistically run multiple tools to optimize the detection
effort? To answer these two questions, we obtained multiple data cleaning tools
that utilize a variety of error detection techniques. We also collected five
real-world data sets, for which we could obtain both the raw data and the ground
truth on existing errors. In this paper, we report our experimental findings on
the errors detected by the tools we tested. First, we show that the coverage of
each tool is well below 100%. Second, we show that the order in which multiple
tools are run makes a big difference. Hence, we propose a holistic multi-tool
strategy that orders the invocations of the available tools to maximize their
benefit, while minimizing human effort in verifying results. Third, since this
holistic approach still does not lead to acceptable error coverage, we discuss
two simple strategies that have the potential to improve the situation, namely
domain specific tools and data enrichment. We close this paper by reasoning
about the errors that are not detectable by any of the tools we tested." class="tooltip">Abstract

                                      multi-core CPUs with many-core GPGPUs. Such heterogeneous architectures have
                                      the potential to improve the performance of data-intensive stream processing
                                      applications, but they are not supported by current relational stream
                                      processing engines. For an engine to exploit a heterogeneous architecture, it
                                      must execute streaming SQL queries with sufficient data-parallelism to fully
                                      utilise all available heterogeneous processors, and decide how to use each
                                      in the most effective way. It must do this while respecting the semantics of
                                      streaming SQL queries, in particular with regard to window handling.

                                      We describe SABER, a hybrid high-performance relational stream processing engine
                                      for CPUs and GPGPUs. SABER executes window-based streaming SQL queries in a
                                      data-parallel fashion using all
                                      available CPU and GPGPU cores. Instead of statically assigning query operators
                                      to heterogeneous processors, SABER employs a new adaptive heterogeneous
                                      lookahead scheduling strategy, which increases the share of queries executing
                                      on the processor that yields the highest performance. To hide data movement
                                      costs, SABER pipelines the transfer of stream data between different memory
                                      types and the CPU/GPGPU. Our experimental comparison against state-of-the-art
                                      engines shows that SABER increases processing throughput while maintaining low

                                      and data users all want to benefit from applying data mining and machine
                                      learning algorithms at scale. A major obstacle towards this “democratisation
                                      of big data” are programming models: current, scalable big data processing
                                      platforms such as Spark, Naiad and Flink require users to learn custom
                                      functional or declarative programming models, which differ fundamentally
                                      from popular languages such as Java, Matlab, Python or C++. An open challenge
                                      is how to provide a big data programming model that users are familiar with,
                                      while maintaining desirable properties such as performance, scalability and
                                      fault tolerance.

                                      We demonstrate JAVA2SDG, a compiler that translates annotated Java programs
                                      to stateful dataflow graphs (SDG) that can execute on a cluster in a
                                      data-parallel and fault-tolerant fashion. Compared to existing distributed
                                      dataflow models, a distinguishing feature of SDGs is that their computational
                                      tasks can access distributed mutable state, thus allowing SDGs to capture the
                                      semantics of stateful Java programs. As part of the demonstration, we provide
                                      examples of machine learning programs in Java, including collaborative
                                      filtering and logistic regression, and we explain how they are translated to
                                      SDGs and executed on a cluster."

                                      algorithms in imperative languages such as Java, Matlab and R. Yet such
                                      implementations fail to achieve the performance and scalability of
                                      specialised data-parallel processing frameworks. Our goal is to execute
                                      imperative Java programs in a data-parallel fashion with high throughput
                                      and low latency. This raises two challenges: how to support the arbitrary
                                      mutable state of Java programs without compromising scalability, and how
                                      to recover that state after failure with low overhead.

                                      Our idea is to infer the dataflow and the types of state accesses from a Java
                                      program and use this information to generate a stateful dataflow graph (SDG).
                                      By explicitly separating data from mutable state, SDGs have specific
                                      features to enable this translation: to ensure scalability, distributed
                                      state can be partitioned across nodes if computation can occur entirely in
                                      parallel; if this is not possible, partial state gives nodes local instances
                                      for independent computation, which are reconciled according to application
                                      semantics. For fault tolerance, large in-memory state is checkpointed
                                      asynchronously without global coordination. We show that the performance of
                                      SDGs for several imperative online applications matches that of existing
                                      data-parallel processing frameworks."

                                      follows the paradigm of stateful data stream processing and is implemented on
                                      top of the SEEP stream processing platform. It achieves high scalability by
                                      massive data-parallel processing and the option of performing semantic
                                      load-shedding. In addition, our solution is fault-tolerant, ensuring that the
                                      large processing state of stream operators is not lost after failure.

                                      Our experimental results show that our solution processes 1 month worth of

                                      we witness a new breed of stream processing systems (SPS) that are designed
                                      to scale to large numbers of cloud-hosted machines. Such systems face new
                                      challenges: (i) to benefit from the “pay-as-you-go” model of cloud computing,
                                      they must scale out on demand, acquiring additional virtual machines (VMs)
                                      and parallelising operators when the workload increases; (ii) failures are
                                      common with deployments on hundreds of VMs—systems must be fault-tolerant
                                      with fast recovery times, yet low per-machine overheads. An open question
                                       is how to achieve these two goals when stream queries include stateful
                                       operators, which must be scaled out and recovered without affecting query
                                       results.

                                       Our key idea is to expose internal operator state explicitly to the SPS
                                       through a set of state management primitives. Based on them, we describe
                                       an integrated approach for dynamic scale out and recovery of stateful
                                       operators. Externalised operator state is checkpointed periodically by the
                                       SPS and backed up to upstream VMs. The SPS identifies individual operator
                                       bottlenecks and automatically scales them out by allocating new VMs and
                                       partitioning the checkpointed state. At any point, failed operators are
                                       recovered by restoring checkpointed state on a new VM and replaying
                                       unprocessed tuples. We evaluate this approach with the Linear Road Benchmark
                                       on the Amazon EC2 cloud platform and show that it can scale automatically to
                                       a load factor of L=350 with 50 VMs, while recovering quickly from failures."

                          <p>
                            Data is stored everywhere: in relational databases, files and hundreds of different data sources. These data sources contain valuable information and insights that can be beneficial to multiple aspects of modern data-driven organizations. However, as more data is produced, our ability to use it reduces dramatically, as no single person in the organization knows about all the existent data sources and so they are lost in the crowd. One big challenge is to discover the data sources that are relevant to answer a particular question. We are building Aurum, a data discovery system to answer "discovery queries" on large volumes of data.

                          <p>
                            The dataflow abstraction implemented as part of large-scale data processing engines has reduced the processing times required to run analytical queries over large volumes of data by exploiting data parallelism, while permitting users to write their algorithms in a high-level language. However, there is a large number of applications that require both data- and task-parallelism--such as complex physical and biological simulations that depend on linear algebra operations. These applications are typically expressed as SPMD programs that intertwine algorithm logic and topology information. This produces hard to understand and error-prone code. We are exploring a new abstraction to bring the benefits of dataflows to HPC-like programs.

                          <p>
			Some applications require both input data and
fine-tuning a set of parameters---such as learning rate, smoothing factor and
optimizer type for machine learning applications---to produce results: we call
these applications exploratory queries. Users spend long times orchestrating
the different parameters they want to try, which is time-consuming and resource
inefficient: each instantiation becomes a dataflow representation that executes
in a dataflow system. Instead, we propose metadataflows as a new dataflow
abstraction for users to represent exploratory queries succcintly.
Metadataflows permit to exploit characteristics that allow us to execute these
kind of queries more efficiently, such as performing sharing of intermediate
results, avoiding redundant computation and using more sophisticated memory
management mechanisms.

                          <p>
                            Large-scale data processing systems depend on stateless dataflows to extract data parallelims and execute the programs with fault tolerance. Many applications that require explicit access to state cannot be executed efficiently in such systems. Stateful data-parallel processing permits to execute stateful programs efficiently and still keeping the data parallelism and fault tolerance properties of traditional dataflow systems. In addition, with state in the applications we can translate imperative programs into stateful dataflow graphs, that can execute on a stateful data-parallel processing system.

				contxt helps you to discuss news with people
you care about. Information overload means that we do not have time to process
the seemingly infinite streams of news we receive every day. contxt helps to
tame this overload by curating news from the many different data sources that
interest you (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, feeds, etc.) and offering them as
concise summaries. You can then start private conversations about those pieces
of news that are more interesting with people you want.  By curating multiple
sources of news and trusting your friends, contxt helps you to stay up to data
without effort.

                                I co-founded this company (Ecana Sistemas de Informacion SL) to help
                                wineries improve their production processes. Ecana acquires data from
                                sensors deployed in wineyards, weather stations and human-provided
                                knowledge. We then transform that data into valuable information to
                                humans and finally we visualise the information in dashboards. The
                                goal was to keep winemakers up to date as to what is going on in their
                                winery and alert them when important events occur such as rising probability
                                of freezing or disease.
