    I am interested in data; how to think about it, what does it mean to make
good use of it, what theory, algorithms, and systems do we need to exploit it,
and how to leverage it to better our lives. I use a variety of approaches to
study these questions.

    <h2>Research Overview</h2>

    <h3>Data Ecology</h3>
    <p>
    <strong><a
href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/ecology.html">Data Ecology</a></strong> is the
name I give to the study of the principles, algorithms, systems, and
methodologies to understand and design data ecosystems. Here's <a
href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/ecology.html">a one-pager</a> overview.
Here's a link to a <a
href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/data-ecology/">Data Science
Institute's Research
Initiative on this topic</a>. There are some data ecosystems to which we have
dedicated more time to date: </p>

    <p>
    <em><u>Data Markets.</em></u> We study data markets, which are an important data
ecosystem. You can see our vision for <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/1323-castrofernandez.pdf">internal (read within organizations) data
markets</a>, a <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/7_31CRstatusofDataMarkets_final.pdf">survey about marketplaces</a>, and some <a
href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/protecting-data-markets-sigmod22.pdf">more</a>
<a
href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/data-sharing-consortia-escrow.pdf">technical</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02543">work</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <em><u>Data Sharing.</em></u> We work a lot on data-sharing markets. One
question that motivates much of this research is how to
incentivize data sharing when beneficial. My NSF
CAREER is studying this <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2340034&HistoricalAwards=false">type
of ecosystem</a>. We have designed and built a <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/data_station_paper-11.pdf">data
escrow</a>, which permits multiple agnets pools and operate on their data. We have
models for incentivizing the <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/data-sharing-consortia-escrow.pdf">formation of data-sharing consortia</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Data Discovery</h3>
    <p>
    I define data discovery as the <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/icde18-aurum.pdf">problem of identifying and
retrieving documents that satisfy an information need</a>. There's a strong
connection to information retrieval but we have concentrated primarily in
tabular data and in data augmentation techniques. This all started with <a
href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/icde18-aurum.pdf">Aurum</a>.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09758">ARDA</a> is an application of Aurum to do feature engineering from external
repositories. Continuations to Aurum include <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/ver.pdf">Ver</a>, and continuations to ARDA
include <a
href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/leva-sigmod22.pdf">Leva</a> and, <a
href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/metam.pdf">Metam</a>. Right now, Metam says all I want to say about data
augmentation. Ver is still evolving. And while we are at it, we have been
exploring the role of LLMs in this context. First with <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/solo-sigmod24.pdf">Solo</a>, a RAG-style system
that uses a self-supervised approach to train automatically, and more recently
with Pneuma, a work in progress. We have started to explore connections between
data discovery and causal inference (really correlation discovery over large
repositories) with <a href="http://raulcastrofernandez.com/papers/nexus-sigmod24.pdf">Nexus</a>.
